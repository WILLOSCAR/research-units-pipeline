Interfaces define what an agent can do, while the loop defines how reliably it does it. This chapter frames tool-using agents as closed-loop systems whose measured performance depends on action representations, tool schemas, and the execution boundary between the model and the environment. A practical consequence is that many apparent method differences collapse to interface and protocol differences once tool access, budgets, and observability are made explicit.

The first subsection isolates the agent loop and action space: state representation, action granularity, recovery behavior, and how observations are fed back into decision making. The second subsection focuses on the tool contract itself - orchestration, permissions, sandboxing, and routing - because these choices determine both correctness and the dominant risk surface under deployment. Read together, the two subsections provide the "execution semantics" needed to interpret later comparisons in planning, memory, and adaptation. [@Gasmi2025Bridging; @Mou2026Toolsafe]
