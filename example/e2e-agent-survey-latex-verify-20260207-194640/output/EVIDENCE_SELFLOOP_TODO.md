## C. Per-subsection TODO (smallest upstream fix path)

## D. Next action

- Evidence looks writeable. Proceed to C5 writing (and keep the evidence policy disclaimer once in front matter).
- If section C lists writability smells, consider fixing them now; they often predict hollow prose even when packs are schema-valid.
