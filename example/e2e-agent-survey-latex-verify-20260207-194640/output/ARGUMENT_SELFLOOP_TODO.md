# Argument self-loop

- Timestamp: `2026-02-07`
- Status: PASS

## What was checked

- Section-by-section argument closure: each H3 makes a concrete claim, supports it with protocol-aware comparisons, and ends with a reusable local takeaway.
- Premise consistency: core terms (agent loop, tool/interface contract, protocol fields) stay stable across H3s.
- Drift control: numeric claims are treated as conditional on task/metric/budget/tool access/threat model, not as model-only properties.

## Notes (non-blocking)

- If you change terminology or protocol assumptions, update `output/ARGUMENT_SKELETON.md# Consistency Contract` first, then revise the affected `sections/*.md`.
- Next units: `transition-weaver` -> `section-merger` -> post-merge QA.
