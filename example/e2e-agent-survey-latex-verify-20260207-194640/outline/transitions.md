# Transitions (merge-injected; paper voice; NO NEW FACTS; NO citations)

- 3.1 -> 3.2: If loop design determines which actions an agent can attempt, the tool/interface contract determines how those actions are encoded, constrained, and audited during execution.
- 4.1 -> 4.2: Planning quality depends on what state and evidence are available at decision time, so memory and retrieval become the mechanism that makes long-horizon deliberation reliable under budget.
- 5.1 -> 5.2: Once behavior can be updated from feedback, the same stability question reappears at the team level, where coordination protocols determine how roles share evidence, verify claims, and avoid correlated drift.
- 6.1 -> 6.2: Protocol metadata makes comparisons meaningful, but deployment decisions additionally hinge on threat models and governance controls that define what robustness means for tool-using systems.
