Agent behavior is not fixed after deployment: many systems incorporate feedback, critique, or self-revision loops that change how decisions are made across episodes. Such adaptation can improve task completion, but it also raises questions about stability and what constitutes a fair comparison when policies continue to change during evaluation [@Shinn2023Reflexion; @Mohammadi2025Evaluation].

Coordination compounds these issues by distributing state and decision-making across multiple interacting agents. Communication protocols, role assignments, and aggregation rules can dominate outcomes, and controlled studies suggest that multi-agent advantages are highly sensitive to interaction structure and task choice [@Wu2025Agents; @Chuang2025Debate; @Papadakis2025Atlas]. This chapter connects adaptation mechanisms and multi-agent coordination under a shared lens: how feedback and interaction policies reshape the agent loop under a fixed protocol.
