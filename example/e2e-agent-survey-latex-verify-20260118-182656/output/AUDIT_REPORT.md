## Template phrase family stats (for fixing)
- pipeline voice ('this run'): 1×
  - han model size alone [@Du2024Anytool; @Liu2025Toolscope]. Method note (evidence policy): this run is abstract-first, so we treat quantitative details as provisional unless a paper note re
- synthesis opener (Taken together, ...): 6×
  - r in tool availability and cost modeling, so cross-benchmark comparisons remain limited. Taken together, the most actionable comparisons focus on how loop boundary choices interact with evaluati
  - her an agent is truly planning or simply sampling many candidates until something works. Taken together, the most informative evidence comes from comparisons that hold protocols fixed while vary
  - s: what changes, what remains fixed, and what evidence supports the claimed improvement. Taken together, adaptation gains are most convincing when they come with protocol-level anchors: benchmar
- meta survey-guidance phrasing (survey ... should ...): 4×
  - avior depends on the environment and metric [@Seo2025Simuhome; @Yao2022React]. Therefore, survey synthesis should emphasize which control-loop assumptions are shared (planner/executor separation, search
  - ablations essential for interpretation [@Wu2025Evolver; @Zhang2026Evoroute]. Therefore, a survey synthesis should treat “adaptation” as a coordination problem across components: what changes, what remain
