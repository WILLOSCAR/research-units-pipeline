Foundations and interfaces set the execution contract for everything that follows: what counts as state, what counts as an action, and what feedback closes the loop. A practical tension is that more expressive action spaces make it easier to solve open-ended tasks, but they also make it harder to verify behavior and to enforce safety boundaries under realistic budgets [@Yao2022React; @Du2024Anytool].

We therefore separate the “agent loop” choice (how decisions and observations are represented) from the “tool interface” choice (how actions are grounded in APIs and orchestrators). The two are intertwined: orchestration policies can effectively redefine the action space, and benchmarks often implicitly assume one loop structure, which can bias conclusions about what works [@Liu2025Mcpagentbench; @Liu2025Toolscope].
