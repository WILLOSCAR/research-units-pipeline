# Transitions (H3 -> next H3; NO NEW FACTS, NO CITATIONS)

- 3.1 → 3.2: While loop design determines what actions are possible, tool interfaces determine how those actions are grounded in executable APIs and orchestration policies.
- 3.2 → 4.1: With the interface contract in view, the next question is how planning and deliberation allocate computation under budgets to decide when and how to act.
- 4.1 → 4.2: Planning determines which decisions to make, whereas memory determines what evidence those decisions can condition on over long horizons.
- 4.2 → 5.1: Once memory policies shape what information is accessible, adaptation asks which parts of behavior can change under feedback and how such updates remain comparable.
- 5.1 → 5.2: As agents adapt over time, multi-agent systems introduce an additional dimension of change: coordination protocols that distribute decision-making and verification across roles.
- 5.2 → 6.1: These coordination designs make protocols and budgets even more central, motivating a closer look at how benchmarks define comparability and cost.
- 6.1 → 6.2: Protocol contracts clarify what success means, but they also determine what risks are exercised, so the next step is to examine safety and governance under explicit threat models.
