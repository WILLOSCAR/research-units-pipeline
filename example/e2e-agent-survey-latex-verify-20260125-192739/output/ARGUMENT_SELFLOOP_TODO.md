# Argument self-loop report

- Status: PASS
- Coverage: SECTION_ARGUMENT_SUMMARIES covers all outline H3 ids (8 of 8)
- Policy: argument ledgers are intermediate artifacts and are not inserted into the paper

## Notes (non-blocking)

- Premise drift watchlist: protocol/budget/tool access/threat model terms are frequent drift triggers; keep them explicit at first use in each chapter.
- If later edits change paragraph structure substantially, regenerate SECTION_ARGUMENT_SUMMARIES so the ledger remains an accurate map.
